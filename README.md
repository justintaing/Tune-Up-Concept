# Tune-Up-Concept
Concept app which determines a user library's most played and most skipped songs. This metric was based on two tags that iTunes and iOS update whenever a song is played or skipped. Remains unfinished.

The intent for this app was to help users identify songs that do not belong in their library (or songs users have not listened to). In doing so, users can then take note to delete such songs, reclaiming storage space; especially relevant for low capacity phones (16GB models).
